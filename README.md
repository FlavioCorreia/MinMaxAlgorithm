# MinMaxAlgorithm
MinMax Algorithm in python applied to tic tac toe

It's a simple aplication of Min Max, so I don't made any error tratment in player options because it wasn't the focus

Basically you choose X or O initially

Then choose your positions on the board using the numbers 0 to 8

ex:

0 | 1 | 2

3 | 4 | 5

6 | 7 | 8

It's impossible win honestly, the best possible case is draw
